# 📘 Week 3 Java Mini Projects – OOPs, ArrayList & Collections Framework

Welcome to Week 3 of my Java Upskilling Journey!  
This week, I focused on deepening my understanding of:

- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
- ✅ Java's ArrayList
- ✅ Java Collections Framework

To solidify these concepts, I’ve built three beginner-friendly mini projects. This repository contains all three, each designed to reinforce specific Java topics.
